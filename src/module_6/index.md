# Introduction to git and Github

When you work on a text document, say your CV using text editors like Google
Docs or Microsoft word, you can undo certain changes using <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> +
<kbd> z </kbd>.

Building a piece of software, can be like working on a text document. Often
times, you'd write code, revert some changes and make certain variations to the
work done overtime.

Things get more interesting when you work in teams, where a few people or
thousands of people work concurrently on the project's codebase. In this case
using <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> z </kbd> is never enough, and often times, you have a working solution you wouldn't want to break, this is the true essence of git and Github.

These two tools along with other substitutes and related technologies form the [Version control system](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/).

Learning git and Github is quite larger than to be crammed into this coursework,
for this reason I have included a video from free code camp.
