Other protocols include [gPPC](https://grpc.io/), [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/),
[AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/)

One of the things we would do in later parts of this book is to write
programs to use these protocols to make network request to resource.

The next section explains what a resource is in detail and uses a sample program
to make a network request
