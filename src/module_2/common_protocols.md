Other protocols include [gPPC](https://grpc.io/), [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/), [AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/).

One of the things we would do in later parts of this book is to write programs that use these protocols to make network request to a resource.

The next section explains what a resource is in detail and uses a sample program to make a network request.
