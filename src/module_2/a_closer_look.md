The internet as we know is today began in the 1960s [^note] as a research project aimed at ease of sharing information from one computer to another. The internet has since evolved to what we have today.

The internet is a probably simpler than you think, it is not a owned by someone or some organization. Remember we discussed computers in the first module of this book? For a refresher, computers are electronic devices, we see them commonly as phones, laptops, smartwatches, servers, and in many other forms. That said, these devices (phone, laptops, servers) are able to talk to each other and share information. The concept of computer communication is the internet. In other words, the internet is the networking of computers.
