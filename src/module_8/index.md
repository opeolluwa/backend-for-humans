# Choosing a programming language

Before we begin this section, I would like to congratulate you for getting past
the preliminary concepts section -- that's module 1 - 7. In this section, our
focus would be on programming! Let's being!

## What you should know

In a sense, choosing your first programming language can be a bit like choosing
your first car. Typically, you want something comfortable and not overpriced.
Here are some key things you should know before choosing a language

<dl>
<dt class="bold-strong"> 1. The end goal</dt>
<dd> What you intend to achieve or the domain you want to programming in </dd>

<dt class="bold-strong"> 2. Adoption</dt>
<dd> When you build applications or software, you'd run into issues and in need of help, it's great to choose a language adopted for the domain, for instance,using Golang for embedded software might be wrong, as of the time of this writing, when compared to the use and adoption of C/C++  </dd>

<dt class="bold-strong"> 3. Learning curve</dt>
<dd> While this isn't exactly a problem when you have excess time, a steep learning curve mean you need to do more groundwork to understand some concepts</dd>
</dl>

Now, let's try to review those keynotes and how this resource help you,

1. **The end goal**: The end goal of this book is to teach you core programming
   concepts and make you a backend engineer.
2. **Adoption**: I have carefully selected 4 programming languages used for
   backend applications
3. **Learning curve**: The 4 available languages have different learning curves
   discussed below;

## Learning Curves

When we discussed the
[classification of programming languages](../module_1/classification_of_programming_languages.md#classification-of-programming-language),
I mentioned 2 classes; compiled languages and interpreted languages, remember?.
Allow me to extend it further to include, _**statically typed languages**_ and
_**dynamically typed languages**_.

### Statically typed languages

In statically typed languages, the programmer is often required to expressively
indicate the type of a
[variable](../module_5/scripts/using-variables.html?highlight=variable#using-variable).
This mean you must state if your variable is a number or letters (string), an
array or something else, and example of such in this resource is the Rust
programming language and Go programming language .

### Dynamically typed languages

In dynamically typed language like JavaScript and Python, it is relatively easy
to get to speed, compared to statically typed languages. However, down the lane
the learning becomes hard to quantify and it seems as if learning is standstill.

Broadly, statically typed languages are longer to be established in and master
but they make it easier to learn other statically typed languages and the
dynamically typed ones rather quickly.

## Which language should you choose?

The short answer is anyone is fine.

Long answer, I've used Rust and JavaScript in and out of work environment and I
can say for a fact that It's always best to know both, personally, I prefer
statically typed language for medium to large-size projects, while I use
JavaScript for small size applications, scripting and prototyping.

The good news is that it is relatively easy to learn other languages when you
are already familiar with one. One thing you must not doing when starting out is
learning two or more programming languages concurrently, it's usually difficult,
frustrating and non-productive.

In the next module, I'll introduce the 4 programming language, I encourage you
to choose one that catches your interest and stick it to the end of the material
for effective learning.

Happy hacking!
