On an average computer, there are several software packages. By this, I mean the likes of **Apple store**, **Safari**, **Slack**, **Spotify**, etc. as seen in the picture below. These packages don't just work out of the box; without the operating system managing the system processes, and other important software like the _boot loader_[^boot] that helps to start up the computer, they cannot be downloaded or used. There's a lot more technical detail regarding Operating Systems, feel free to do some external reading to suit your interest.

The operating system is, perhaps, the most important software that a computer runs; it manages the computer's hardware, software, memory, and processes. You can't see it like the other software packages that you use, but it operates beneath them all.

The operating system belongs to a category of software called **System software**, while the other category includes all forms of software that you interact with daily as a conventional computer user; this category is known as **Application software**.

Other examples of system software are Compilers and Interpreters[^compilers] which was introduced in module one.

The application software would mean the myriads of tools we use everyday, like the Internet browser, word processors, image viewer.
