# Introduction to Operating Systems

In the previous modules, we established that computers, regardless of their form (laptop, desktop, mobile, etc.) or their use (gaming, video editing, software development, etc.), don't do anything magical.

To speak plainly, they're essentially a lump of plastic, metals, and electronic circuitry (hereafter called the **hardware**), powered by complex logic encoded as a form of a program.

We'd like to also established that, the software we write makes it possible to achieve almost any feat, as as much as we can think it, we probably can code it and make it work.

It will suffice to say that, these software we develop are managed on the target device by a **house keeper** present on that device. Although, this is not the case, on some devices. That said, I will like to establish that, this **house keeper** does all the heavy lifting of gluing our program unto the electronics hardware. It helps our computer understand what we want. This house keeper is also a kind of software, called **the Operating System**.

Operating Systems (OS) is a broad topic on its own. In this module, you will learn the basics that will aid assimilation of the remainder of the material.

## Learning expectation

At the end of this module, you should the able to

1. Explain Operating system in your own words

2. Describe systems programming

3. Give examples of Operating systems

## Learning Requirement

No additional requirement is needed for this module.
