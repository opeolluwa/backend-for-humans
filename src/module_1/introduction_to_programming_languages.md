Programming language is a system of notation that uses special signs, keywords, symbols, and expressions to communicate with and by extension, instruct a computer.

Computer programs, as discussed in the previous part of this module, are sets of instructions passed to a computer to carry out a task.

To further understand programming languages, think about the natural languages like English, Russian, Spanish, and many more. The ability to **speak** English, Russian or Spanish help you communicate with someone in the United States, purchase something from a seller in Saint Petersburg, Russia, or study in Universitat de Barcelona, Spain as long as you can clearly communicate and understand them.

In the same manner, practical knowledge a programming language is a critical prerequisite for telling computers what to do and getting a desired response.

The computer is capable of doing a lot of things but only if you can clearly tell it what you need it to do.
