Programming language is a system of notation that uses special signs, keywords,
symbols, and expressions to communicate with and by extension, instruct a
computer.

Computer programs, as discussed in the previous part of this module, are sets of
instructions passed to a computer to carry out a task.

To further understand programming languages, think about the natural languages
like English, Russian, Spanish, and many more. The ability to **speak** English,
Russian or Spanish help you communicate with someone in the United States,
purchase something from a seller in Saint Petersburg, Russia, or study in
Universitat de Barcelona, Spain as long as you can clearly communicate and
understand them.

In the same manner, the ability to speak **programming language** is a
prerequisite for telling computers what to do and getting a response.

What's more interesting is, the computer is capable of doing a lot of things, if
and only if you can clearly tell it what you need it to do.
