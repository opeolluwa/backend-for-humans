## What is computer programming?

Broadly, computer programming is telling a computer exactly what to do.
Typically, the programmer need to understand the problem to be solved or the
task at hand. Afterwords, the solution is implemented using special words,
signs, and symbols, collective called code.


The end result is like giving the computer a recipe so it knows how to make
something happen.


These special sets of words, signs and symbols constitute the term **computer programming languages**, a concept we will explore in detail.


A fitting analogy to understand code and programming language is liking code to
an English Essay and liking Programming language to the English language
