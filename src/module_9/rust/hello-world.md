# Hello World program in Rust

In this section, we are going to install the Rust programming language and write
a basic program that prints "Hello World!"

## What is an "Hello World" program ?

Put simple, it is writing a program that prints "Hello world" (or "Hello,
world!"). It's like some sort of ritual in the board programming community to
welcome yourself; just like a baby's first cry.

## Installing the Rust programming language toolchain.
