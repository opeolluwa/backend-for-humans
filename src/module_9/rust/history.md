# History of Rust programming language

Rust started as a side project for Graydon Hoare, a previous employee of
Mozilla. reports says Horae was frustrated by the breakdown of the elevator in
his apartment and decided to build a programming language that is guaranteed to
work without crashes, like the one in his apartment's elevator. [^note]

The project was adopted by Mozilla in 2010 and the first stable release was made
in 2015. Since this time, Rust has been voted by the
[Stackoverfow developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/) as the
most loved programming language for several years in a roll

The language is managed by the [Rust foundation](https://rustfoundation.org/)
