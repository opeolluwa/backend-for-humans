# Introduction to the Rust programming language

## Quick Overview

Here's a quick overview of the Rust programming language

The Rust programming language, according to its official website is <em>"A
language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software"</em>

Let's break this down;

When applications are built in certain programming languages there are almost
always certain discrepancies (inadequacies, vulnerabilities, security issues,
trade-offs) lurking around, some of which are attributed to the programming
language of choice, while the rest can usually be traced to the way the code was
written or the way short-coming (error, edge case, overlook, omission) in the
implementation.

The Rust programming takes a rather strict and unconventional approach to
getting rid of most of these issues, without compromising the execution speed nor security.

The primary goal of the Rust programming language is to take away all the "land
mines" you could step on while coding and certain security vulnerabilities
ardent to other systems programming languages [^note] like C/C++.

Although, the Rust programming language is intended to be a systems programming
language, there is a continued adoption to non-systems application domain, like
web, mobile and general purpose softwares.

In the next few sections, we'd talk briefly about the history of Rust
programming language, it adoption and use cases.

[^note]: Systems programming languages are programming languages used to develop
[system software](../../module_3/meeting_the_house_keeper.html) like Operating
Systems, Compiles, Interpreters, and such like.
