# Use cases of the Rust programming language

The Rust programming language as of the time of this writing in currently used
in these domains:

1. **Android application development**: Rust is currently being used to build
   [native android apps](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/rust/building-rust-modules/overview),
   or in conjunction with web frameworks through projects like
   [Tauri](https://tauri.apps)

2. **Browsers**: Projects like [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo), Mozilla
   firefox and many other browsers uses Rust to implement som emission critical
   parts of the projects

3. **Databases**: Database projects like
   [Ahnlich](https://github.com/deven96/ahnlich), [Persy](https://persy.rs/),
   [Surrealdb](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb), and many more have been
   implemented successfully in Rust and many are currently used in Production
   environment.
4. **Developer tooling** The popular web framework,
   [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) currently uses Rust to speed up
   compile times.
5. **Servers** Several businesses uses many Rust web framework like
   [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum),
   [Wrap](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp), [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/),
   [Actix web](https://actix.rs/) and many more to build their servers and
   achieve their business goals

I've barely scratched the surface here; the Rust use cases continue to broaden
by the day. Consider checking out the
