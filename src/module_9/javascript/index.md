JavaScript, also called ECMAScript, and not to be confused with another
programming language, called Java, was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 to add
interactivity to websites.

Back in those days, there weren't beautiful and dynamic websites as seen today,
JavaScript was one of the major tools that made this a reality.

However, it has evolved to support various other use cases, including backend
development, mobile applications, machine learning, task automation,
[scripting](../../module_5/scripts/anatomy.md) and many more.
