# History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape
Communications Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript,
before finally being named JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at
the time.

Not until 2009 when [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org), (discussed shortly), was
released, JavaScript was used predominantly (if not entirely) for building
websites along with HTML and CSS.

## What is NodeJS?

Every web browsers has JavaScript engine (JavaScript interpreter, JavaScript
runtime), which makes it possible to programmatically control or modify the
website, through two major interfaces called the _**Document Object Model**_ and
the _**Browser Object Model**_. The JavaScript engine is also essentially for
effective functioning of JavaScript frameworks (and libraries) like Vue, Angular
and React which you have probably heard of.

In 2009, a man called [Ryan Dahl](https://x.com/rough__sea?), created something
that has since broaden the use of JavaScript. Ryan "extracted" the JavaScript
engine from a browser and make it use able outside the browser, he called this
creation NodeJS

With NodeJs, it is now possible for to use JavaScript for virtually anything.

In 2010, [npm](https://npmjs.org)[^note] was created, this made it possible to
use other people's code, or code fragments also know as frameworks[^framework],
or libraries[^library] which they give out freely (Open Source Codes), thus
increasing the strength of the JavaScript community.

Other important things to note are:

1. 2010, [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/) A tool for building servers
   (backend)
2. 2012, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) another programming
   language, modelled after JavaScript
3. 2013, [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) - A tool for creating desktop
   applications
4. 2015, [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - A tool for building mobile
   applications and desktop applications JavaScript
5. 2018, [Deno](deno.land) Deno is a runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and
   WebAssembly that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine
6. [Bun](https://bun.sh/) Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime

The Bottom line is, JavaScript has been around for almost three decades and, a
number of dictators have tried to overthrow it (pun intended). I don't think it
would be going anywhere anytime soon, especially with it increasing adoption

[^note]: NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It's a free, open-source registry
and command-line tool for JavaScript software packages

[^framework]: Frameworks are often used as the foundation for building apps for
specific platforms, they can be likened to skeleton

[^library]: A library a collection of pre-written code that programmers can use
to create applications, A fitting analogy is a collection of fabrics, buttons,
threads e.t.c that seamstresses keep, with the right combination of choice you
can make any dress
