# Summary

In this module;

1. We explored and installed the Rust and JavaScript toolchain
2. We wrote and execute an hello world program

In the next and subsequent modules, the lessons would be mostly video content as
opposed to text-first approach you've see up to this point.

Strap in and happy hacking!
