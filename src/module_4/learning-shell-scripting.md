# Learning Shell scripting

## What is Shell Scripting?

Shells are interactive interfaces that accept commands from the user, typically through the keyboard. For tasks beyond routine instructions, this becomes a very difficult thing to do, thus the scripts are saved in files and passed to the Command Line Interpreter (CLI). This is
Shell scripting.

 letters.
2. Open the folder in your terminal.
