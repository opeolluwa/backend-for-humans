# Learning Shell scripting

## What is Shell Scripting?

Shells are interactive interfaces that accept commands from a user, typically through the keyboard. For tasks beyond routine instructions, this becomes a very difficult thing to do, so the scripts are saved in files and passed to the Command Line Interpreter (CLI). This is Shell scripting in a nutshell.

To begin;

1. Create a folder on your desktop, call it `workspace`. Ensure to use lowercase letters.

2. Open the folder in your terminal.

Now we are ready to delve into shell scripting.
