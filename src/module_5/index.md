# Writing shell scripts

In the previous module, we introduced common shell commands and executed them directly from the shell terminal. We'll build on previously established concepts and show you how to write and execute shell scripts in this module. You might need to review [module 4](../module_4/index.md) if this is your first shell scripting encounter.

## Learning expectation

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Explain what a shell interpreter is

2. Write and execute a shell script from a file

3. Make a shell script an executable

4. Read a shell file and explain what it is supposed to do.

## Learning requirement

For this module, you need:

1. Vscode

2. Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows)

See the [setup instructions from module 4](../module_4/tools/index.md)
