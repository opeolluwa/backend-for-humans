# Module review

In this module, we learnt about the process of saving your script to a file and executing it, as opposed to entering commands directly via the keyboard, as demonstrated in module 4. We also covered important concepts such as how to make your shell script executable, working with arrays, performing conditional evaluations, utilizing for loops, and reading shell scripts effectively.
