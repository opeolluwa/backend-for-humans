# Using arrays

Arrays are a special type of containers that hold multiple values at the same time.

For instance, the rainbow is made of 7 colors. We can create an array variable that holds all the colors of the rainbow.

Create a new file named `arr` and add the following lines of code to the file.

```sh
{{#include ../../code-samples/module_5/shell-array}}
```

Make it this file executable and run the script.

You should see the following output:

```sh
red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
```
