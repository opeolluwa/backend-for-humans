# Elementary programming concepts

In the last module, we installed NodeJs, which is the JavaScript runtime
environment we would be using in this book, we also installed the Rust
toolchain.

In this module we will explore some foundational concepts essential for building
any meaningful program, there would also be a couple of video guides to enhance
the learning process, and finally we'd have a exercise.

## Learning expectation

At the end of the module, you should be able to

1. Set up a new project for your choice programming language
2. Explain the following terms:
   - a. package
   - b. package management
   - c. package repository
3. Understand variables, values, operators and control flow
4. Use a package
5. Solve the classical fizz-buzz challenge
