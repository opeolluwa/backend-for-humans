Backend roadmap for non-technical people

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To build the application locally, you need:

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- [just](https://just.systems)

### Executing program

#### Clone and set up the project

Setting up the project can take a few to several minutes due to your machine and
the network speed

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opeolluwa/backend-for-humans 
cd backend-for-humans
just install-dependencies
```

#### Run the project in watch mode

```sh
just watch
```
